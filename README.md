# Artemis Plugin repository template

## How to use this template

1. Create a new repository using this template
2. Change the name of the repository to something more meaningful. The name of the repository will be the name of the plugin. The recommended format is `Artemis.Plugins.<Something>`.
3. The Github Actions workflow will run automatically and create:
    - The structure of the repository, with the recommended folder structure
    - A new plugin ready to be developed.
    - Pre-configured gitignore and CI so you can focus on the code
4. **Important**: The workflow will take a few minutes to run. You can check the progress in the Actions tab of your repository. Do not start developing until the workflow has finished. If you can read this, the workflow has NOT finished yet.
4. Start developing your plugin
